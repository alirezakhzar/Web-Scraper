Auto Clicker for Web Bonus Button
This Python script automates clicking a "Get money" button on a web page using Selenium and Microsoft Edge WebDriver. It refreshes the page every 65 seconds to ensure the button is available for the next click.
Features
Automatically clicks the "Get money" button on the specified webpage
Refreshes the page every 65 seconds
Uses Microsoft Edge WebDriver for browser automation
Handles errors gracefully without crashing
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Microsoft Edge browser installed
Edge WebDriver (msedgedriver.exe) compatible with your Edge version
Installation
Install the required Python packages:
-----pip install selenium-----

Run
Download the Edge WebDriver:
Go to Microsoft Edge WebDriver
Download the version that matches your Edge browser version
Extract the msedgedriver.exe file to a known location
Usage
Update the WebDriver path in the script:
----- service = Service('path/to/your/msedgedriver.exe')-----

Update the target URL if needed:
----- driver.get('https://your-target-url.com')-----

Run the script:
  -----python from_selenium_import_webdriver.py-----

Run
When the page loads, press Enter in the console to start the auto-clicking process.
How It Works
The script opens Microsoft Edge and navigates to the specified URL
It waits for you to press Enter to start the auto-clicking process
It searches for the "Get money" button (an <a> tag with class "button")
If found, it clicks the button
It waits for 65 seconds
It refreshes the page
The process repeats indefinitely
Error Handling
If the button is not found, the script prints a message and continues
If any other error occurs, it prints the error message and continues
Customization
Adjust the wait time by changing the time.sleep(65) value
Modify the button selector if the target element changes
Notes
Make sure your Edge browser and WebDriver versions match
The script may need adjustments if the website structure changes
Some websites may have anti-bot measures that could prevent this script from working
